  * Merge pull request #25 from blutack/patch-1
    Warn rather than error if framerate can't be set
  * Warn rather than error if framerate can't be set
    The driver doesn't currently work with em28xx based devices as they don't allow the framerate to be set directly and the node exits with an error. Changing to a warning allows these devices to be used.
  * Update README.md
  * Merge pull request #24 from rjw57/do-not-touch-parameters-unless-asked
    do not modify parameters unless explicitly set
  * do not modify parameters unless explicitly set
    The contrast, saturation, brightness, sharpness and focus parameters
    were recently added to usb_cam. This caused a regression
    (sigproc/robotic_surgery#17) whereby the default settings for a webcam
    are overridden in all cases by the hard-coded defaults in usb_cam.
    In the absence of a know good set of "default" values, leave the
    parameters unset unless the user has explicitly set them in the launch
    file.
